Cybersecurity Internship Tasks Documentation

This repository documents the tasks I completed as part of my cybersecurity internship tasks. The tasks include phishing awareness training, secure coding review, and setting up a network intrusion detection system. Below is a summary of each task and the steps I took to complete them.

Task 2: Phishing Awareness Training Objective
The goal of this task was to create a presentation or online training module to educate others about phishing attacks. The training focuses on recognizing and avoiding phishing emails, websites, and social engineering tactics.
Steps Completed
    Researched common phishing techniques and real-world examples.
    Created a presentation that includes:
        Definition of phishing and its impact.
        Examples of phishing emails and websites.
        Tips for identifying phishing attempts.
        Best practices for avoiding phishing attacks.
    Developed an interactive online training module using tools like Google Slides or PowerPoint.
    Included a quiz at the end of the training to test participants' understanding.
    
Task 3: Secure Coding Review Objective
This task involved reviewing code for security vulnerabilities and providing recommendations for secure coding practices. I chose a programming language and application to analyze.
Steps Completed
    Selected Python as the programming language and a sample web application for review.
    Used static code analysis tools like Bandit and Pylint to identify vulnerabilities such as:
        SQL injection.
        Cross-site scripting (XSS).
        Hardcoded credentials.
    Manually reviewed the code for additional security issues.
    Provided recommendations for secure coding practices, including:
        Input validation.
        Use of prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        Regular dependency updates to avoid vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    Documented the findings and recommendations in a detailed report.
    
Task 4: Network Intrusion Detection SystemObjective
The goal of this task was to develop a network-based intrusion detection system (IDS) using tools like Snort. I set up rules and alerts to identify and respond to suspicious network activity.
Steps Completed
    Installed Snort and required dependencies (WinPcap/Npcap) on a Windows 11 machine.
    Configured Snort rules by downloading and setting up the rule directory.
    Modified the snort.conf file to include my system's IP address and correct rule paths.
    Tested the Snort configuration using the command:
    Set up alert rules to monitor suspicious network activity using the command:
    Verified that Snort successfully detected and logged suspicious activities.
    Explored options for visualizing detected attacks using tools like Wireshark or ELK Stack.
    
Conclusion
These tasks allowed me to gain hands-on experience in key areas of cybersecurity, including phishing awareness, secure coding practices, and network intrusion detection. Each task was completed with a focus on practical implementation and documentation to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
